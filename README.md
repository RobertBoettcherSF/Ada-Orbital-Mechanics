# Orbital Mechanics in Ada 2023

## Project Overview
This project provides a robust, strongly-typed implementation of fundamental two-body orbital mechanics in Ada 2023 (ISO/IEC 8652:2023), modeled after the principles described in the Wikipedia entry for Orbital Mechanics. The implementation encompasses the foundational formulations governing Keplerian motion, including the Vis-Viva equation for all conic trajectory regimes (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic), Kepler's Third Law and its harmonic inversions, specific mechanical energy and momentum conservation, and iterative numerical solvers for both elliptic and hyperbolic formulations of Kepler's Equation using Newton-Raphson iteration.

## Features
* Strong typing eliminating raw primitives: domain types for `Distance`, `Speed`, `Gravitational_Parameter`, `Eccentricity`, `Time_Seconds`, and `Radians`.
* Subtype categorization enforcing physical validity at compile- and run-time (`Elliptic_Eccentricity`, `Hyperbolic_Eccentricity`, `Positive_Distance`, `Positive_Time`).
* Ada contract aspects (`Pre`, `Post`) guarding mathematical domain constraints.
* Orbital velocity formulations:
  * General Vis-Viva Equation: v^2 = mu * (2/r - 1/a)
  * Circular velocity: v_c = sqrt(mu / r)
  * Escape velocity: v_esc = sqrt(2 * mu / r)
  * Hyperbolic excess velocity: v_inf = sqrt(-mu / a)
* Kepler's Third Law (Harmonic Law):
  * Period calculation from semi-major axis
  * Inverted calculation: semi-major axis from orbital period
  * Mean motion (angular frequency) computation
* Specific orbital invariants:
  * Specific orbital energy (vis-viva conservation)
  * Specific relative angular momentum: h = sqrt(p * mu)
  * Semi-latus rectum computation
* Apsidal geometry (periapsis and apoapsis calculations).
* Kepler's Equation solvers:
  * Elliptic solver for M = E - e * sin(E)
  * Hyperbolic solver for M_h = e * sinh(H) - H
  * True anomaly derivation from eccentric anomaly
  * Radial distance evaluation as a function of true anomaly
* Coplanar two-impulse Hohmann transfer orbit analyzer (Delta-V budgets and transfer time of flight).

## Testing
The test suite in `tests.adb` executes 13 distinct test scenarios containing 42 discrete assertions:
* **Functional Correctness:** Asserts numerical accuracy of vis-viva equations, escape speeds, and orbital periods against established values for LEO and GEO regimes.
* **Conservation Laws:** Validates that total specific orbital energy matches theoretical values for bound, parabolic, and hyperbolic orbits, and confirms angular momentum conservation across periapsis and apoapsis.
* **Iterative Convergence:** Exercises Newton-Raphson solvers across both elliptic and hyperbolic regimes, confirming that substituted roots solve Kepler's equation to within numerical tolerances.
* **Edge Cases & Invariants:** Verifies behavior at circular eccentricity bounds (e = 0.0), collision trajectories (e = 1.0), and guarantees `Singularity_Error` triggers when orbital parameters violate energy constraints.

## Building
* **Compiler Requirements:** GNAT supporting Ada 2022 / Ada 2023 (`-gnat2022` or `-gnat2023`).
* **Flags:** Zero warnings under `-gnatwa`.
* **Clean Artifacts:** Run `make clean` to remove build directories (`obj/` and `bin/`).
